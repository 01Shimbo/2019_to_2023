Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.

I saw the power of functions during the scene program we can call them in different filles and the same file.

2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?

test functions allow for people to make a test script to start debugging while a different person can make the code.

3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?

I use Jupiter notebooks which allows code to be ran block by block.
I need to use debugging tools more often when I get unexpected results 
because those tools can tell you the value of variables while the code is running.
